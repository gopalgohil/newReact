      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        Hello! I'm a junior web developer with a passion for creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. I enjoy solving 
        problems through code and continuously strive to enhance my skills. My current toolkit includes HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
        and React, and I am always looking to learn more!
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-4">
        With a strong interest in front-end development, I focus on building websites that are not only visually appealing but also 
        provide a seamless user experience. Whether it's coding a simple static site or working with dynamic frameworks, I love every 
        step of the process.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700">
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, reading up on web trends, or contributing to open-source projects.
        Iâ€™m excited to continue growing as a developer and contributing to the tech community!
